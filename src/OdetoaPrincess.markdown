# Ode to a Princess

Princess, from which spring did you sprung?  
Yesteryear, like a flood down rolling mountains,  
or tomorrow bursting from a soaking tongue.  
You, the most oozing of youthful fountains,  
the prized picture in my crystal ball.  
Favorite niece, sweet child of mine,  
my youth, my home, my love, my crown!  
Stranger, a mist that twirls and twines,  
a comfortable fog who you dare not call  
a cloud of mind to the wonder of it all.  
Beloved subject, one day I'll turn you down!  

For I am nostalgic for the days of yore,  
the days when you weren't fixed in form.  
In our breath, our thought, but wasn't sure,  
but a distant haze, a buzzing swarm.  
Who came and laid the greens in a fiery show;  
fireflies — millions upon millions more  
flickering under the sun and its mistress   
kissing — the land blushing, shocked sore —  
with the red cloaks singing even though  
their desire is mired in the golden glow   
of hellfire, hellfire, heaven's light, and hellfire.  

Brave knight, you can not save what burned to ash;  
the fierce flames send shivers down your spine,  
a tingle, a sensation so subtle until it clash  
and wreaks havoc under the guise of "I feel fine".  
The raging emptiness you hold inside,  
will it seep into a new idea, a brilliant phrase?  
Set things straight that didn't need to be aligned.  
A curiosity exploring a warrior's heart, a lunar phase,  
the white colossus of the sky that pulls the tide,  
in and out, day and night, the sun's destined bride.  
To think that the great eight once were nine.
