# A Siren's Song

Mystique was first to grab my hand;  
my childishness her joy.  
With rhythmic thrusts to a mellow beat  
she charmed me acting coy.  

Shaped into what I had in mind  
I let myself run wild,  
and made my myth a hollow craze,  
and begged to be beguiled.  

My cosmic wave had sent me straight  
on a quest across the sky;  
where empty space is made to matter  
and ancient legends lie.  

But among the stars and planets,  
the empty space between,  
the electric warrior's furious tune  
couldn't fill the scene.  

His bleeding solo gave no echo:  
it simply fucking died.  
So he smeared his blood to eternity  
hoping some would dry.  

Like every other fool before  
whose blood now glaced the sky,  
and left us all forever awed  
how pain might short the eye.  

You drifted, but then I saw your bride,  
the body for which you're bound,  
and you must felt my crimson burning  
for you shot for solid ground.  

I dived into the hands of Mars,  
embraced by off-world charm.  
Looking warm but cold at heart,  
what could be the harm?  

Did you know, pretty prince, my wish  
for you to conquer stars,  
to put them all in bulbs one day  
all labeled "Made on Mars".  

My heart, it jumped and made a ripple,  
and a cosmic wave was born,  
bestowing life to this siren's song  
forever and evermore.
