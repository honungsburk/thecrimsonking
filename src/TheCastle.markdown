# The Castle

The spell was broken, the castle about to fall  
under the sun's thousand-year-old pressure  
on the crimson cloaks to tear down its walls  
and leave the king with his only treasure.  
To catch him naked and then undress him,  
stuttering his answers to their every whim.  

The first to fall was the gaudy chandelier,  
a centerpiece that stole too much attention,  
a display of wealth to detract from the austere  
condition that its shadow would never mention.  
And as his brilliant candles hit the floor,  
it cracked so deep its shadow lept from the wall.  

He knew that future men would one day say  
that the crack was where it all began  
and never hail the sun that gave away  
its rays to shine on the burgeoning mountain  
built from the rubble of this abandoned castle,  
solid, with no halls to hide in.  

Do you think of the dark side of the moon?  
Or the light that never kisses a body?  
Believing the two immortals know of bliss   
where all pain is shared with one another?  
Fear not, however close we are miles apart,  
two cosmonauts who just happened to cross paths.
