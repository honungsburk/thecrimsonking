# Lady Fair

Kindle my spirit, spirit of a dove,  
the rock in rock 'n' roll love;  
fair lady, lady fair,  
who's wicked love turned me sane,  
to give such a gift so carelessly away!  

Set a flame, flames above the tops  
of church towers and wedding props;  
lovely lady, lady love,  
the virgin mistress who drinks my crimson.  
Oh! how love turns what simply isn't.  

Pulling my strings, stringing me along  
an eternal tour through the land of wrong;  
prized lady, lady prizes,  
taken at dusk to be returned by dawn,  
if I could only keep you beyond the morn'!
