# A Wandering Star

I had not cleared my path — been dwarfed — I fell  
through a crack, my eyes watered from the speed  
of the wind that blew past me, as I entered hell.  
I was measured, weighted, and told to cry my plead  
because it would be deep and know no end.  
I'd spilled sober thoughts to the wrong friend.  

I searched the hall for a dead man's boots  
"lucky as always", my stoned self stammered.  
My bones and yaw were tangled in roots,  
for one of nature's spirits had got me hammered  
and soon it all would vanish — the miracle die —  
and another brave cosmonaut be stuck in the sky.  

There was still fuel with which to tease his guest  
chained between the best and the better world  
in the state of fixed but not possessed.  
Its potential crumbled as his head was whirled   
from his stumble across the creases — hard pressed —  
to scared to let my comfort be undressed.  

Are you not the famed cosmic dancer?  
Visiting yourself on your 'tour de Chambre'.  
A bright light that holds no answer  
but themes were the subjects drown in rum.  
Answering every question with the whirling words:  
"We live in the best of all possible worlds!"  

By the river young men were skipping rocks  
inviting me to join their fine pastime  
and seeing as passion is but a black box  
perhaps a skip and plunge could restore my prime,  
taking me on top the hill that kept me blind,  
and let me view the orchards of my mind.  

Describe yourself — naked — in the flesh  
pulling your mind through the thick of herbs,  
letting your image crack, exposed afresh,  
and hear yourself spill the words  
you've kept so close though they hurt,  
telling truth in a fictitious flirt  

Perhaps your kink is to be dressed down,  
to fell it raw on raw — love without bounds.  
Pacing your moans as it eclipses your crown  
and peaks as you sip the wine made from the sound  
of silence where nothing is covered up  
and one drop gives way to an entire cup.  

You demon — angel — with claws and fangs,  
strokes of danger, and crimson flair,  
endangered beast, hunted by gangs  
of wealthy thieves with silver hair.  
Tell me, why do you love me so?  
There is nothing I won't let you know.  

Once sober, I contemplated my pledge.  
The young men urging me to dissolve  
my rough life full of edges,  
throw away my duties, abdicate and evolve  
my state of being, from a lifeless essence  
to an immutable immortal adolescence.  

Everything was left spinning  
from when I pulled the safety pin.  
The explosion left my ears ringing.  
Is this what it means to win?  
To be covered in feathers and tar,  
thinking yourself a wandering star.
