# I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive

With ribbons in their mouths, the sky as their floor,  
that shifts and moves in see-through pinks and blues.  
The wonders of cosmos soon lost by the shore  
of oblivion, stronger than any other brew,  
longer lasting, the most mellow of the hues.  
As colored dots and swarms of grey arrive,  
I greet them with jokes while showing off the view.  
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.  

Later, thinking about the doomsday-four,  
the quartet to orchestrate the coup  
on human life with all its joy and chore,  
and sing it out on a bittersweet adieu!  
That twists my heart like when you caught the flu,  
or when a comment strayed and hit you in the side  
and poured you on the rocks, starving for advice.  
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.  

Don't you hear the cosmic dancers rave and play?  
The legends bombard every inch of floor.  
Can't you feel the shock on every single day  
as they tap their feet chanting: “Nevermore!”  
Don't you feel it slip — déjà vu, déjà vu —  
I write a rave review, a four out of five,  
and forget I ever uttered death's sweet woo:  
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.  

But then that eerie feeling strikes and undo  
all worldly joys and treats that give us drive,  
and for a moment only otherworldly do:  
I wish I could just die; I wish I was alive.
