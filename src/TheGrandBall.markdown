# The Grand Ball

A full moon knocked on heaven's door,  
where a slender body boiled in water,  
pulled to be spread on the marble floor,  
fair skinned, earth's most cherished daughter.  
His eyes were blank, there was nothing but white.  
A lump hot steaming mess fixed in agony,  
one of the great-great souls brought back to sight,  
a half-hearted retort to life's supposed monogamy.  

"One of those days, just one of those days"  
as foreign carriages approached the castle  
where colored dots and swarms of gray  
spilled out to view their conquered vassal.  
They were greeted by a royal smile,  
but favored instead the crimson red,  
muttering for the miracle child,  
exclaiming, "where—where is it?"  

Bathed in salt as if formed in ocean,  
on top a shell to be draped by Spring,  
the eternal lover's favorite motion  
with copper hair curled just like the wind.  
The theater was laid in silverlight,  
and a purple haze embraced the crowd,  
roaring at the hint of a shadow of a sign.  
The rich mood dampened as the wind began to howl.  

A stir in the clouds — an acid rain  
a giant's fist's shattering sound  
— a pinch of pain — trembling in awe  
edged to the brim — boiling in rage  
that's when she threw himself on stage.  

It's here! It lives, it moves us!  
It behooves us! To take it where it groves us!  
My pencil, pen and rockstar muse...  
So obtuse, it fades — (barely used)  

Do not ring my door; this is not my home.  
All parties must part their ways,  
and I drink my crimson red alone
