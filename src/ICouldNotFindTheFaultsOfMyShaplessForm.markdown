# I could not find the faults in my shapeless form

I could not find the faults in my shapeless form,  
nor could I keep the sun and moon from kissing;  
eternal figures shy not to perform,  
while I am drifting as a cloud gone missing.  
"Ha," laughs the crimson king, "our stupid lore,  
a portrait missing all that others should know  
instead you rippled from the wieght of war,  
and was charmed by myth and mystique dancing slow.  
Sigh, he and I are speaking with one tongue  
about us filling empty buckets full,  
to feel them overflow, the spring be sprung  
to warmth, to prince to princess, to have it pull  
you back into a simple twist of fate â€”  
lacking breath I'd swallowed my own bait.
