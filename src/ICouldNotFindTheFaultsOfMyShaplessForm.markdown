# I could not find the faults in my shapeless form

I could not find the faults in my shapeless form,  
nor could I keep the sun and moon from kissing;  
eternal figures shy not to perform,  
while I be drifting as a cloud gone missing.  
while I drift as a cloud gone missing.  
The Crimson King is laughing, "Oh, I'm yours!
a portrait missing all that should be known,
instead you rippled from the wieght of war,  
and let mystique led you to be alone.  
See? We've been speaking with one tongue,  
both be filling empty buckets full  
to feel them overflow, the spring be sprung  
to warmth, to prince to princess, to have it pull  
you back into a simple twist of fate" â€”  
lacking breath I'd swallowed my own bait.
