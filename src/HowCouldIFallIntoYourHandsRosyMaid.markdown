# How could it fall into your hands rosy maid?

How could it fall into your hands rosy maid?   
The snows of winter now in pouring spring.   
The Crimson King, who mourns on feathers laid,   
say, “Love across the lake... must art this bring?   
My canvas — fair — insight for all to bear;   
my world of ice, the beauty of winter's gloom,   
now face the rising sun to sweat, to tear;   
its beauty lay revealed in bleeding bloom.”   
But let it bleed, let it cry, let the white dove die;   
you gnawing wraiths drink its blood   
the wisping winds whip its love   
fault in form but form is fault  

Have autumn decay the way it was meant,  
while love remains our sweetest budding scent.
