# Throne Of Might

Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might,  
and flee this castle and its stolen tract.  
Be borne on the wind to ever higher height.  

Among hot sheets of silk lies our fight.  
The aftermath of bloody Mars' loving act.  
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might.  

May what sprung prove worthy above all right,  
A bastard demi-god who'll have the world sacked;  
Be borne on the wind to ever higher height.  

Conquering each other's fears in the sacred rite.  
White stone beaten soft, beautifully cracked.  
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might.  

Brave the violent seas and tumble by its smite,  
Lick the warm salt, embrace your loving pact;  
Be borne on the wind to ever higher height.  

Fear a dove's loving lie, its shroud of white  
Wash ashore, soaked in blisters, still intact.  
Fall from your throne, your dying seat of might;  
be borne on the wind to ever higher height.
