# All Along the Interlude

Through mist, the rider came damp in heavy clothes.  
"Is this the way?", he asked  
for he wasn't sure.  
"Depends," said the gentleman.  
"Of course," the charlatan.  
    "Never," spoke the crow.  
They all died in laughter, the prelude  
to the tale all along the interlude.  

He mounted his bike that bleak morning  
when wind scuffled the leaves  
and rode the trees.  
When the levee breaks we'll have no place.  
Can you hear the caw over wind and wave,  
awakening their deepest, most inner rage:  
crying floods, a burning temper. How rude —  
to flush us down all along the interlude.  

The alleys crawled with sickening thoughts  
passing them by under flickering lights.  
"Thanks for tonight,"  
said as their hands unlocked  
and their (final?) eclipse was broken off.  
The spectacle, caught in the wrong view,  
by one who watch, one who pursue,  
eternal figures all along the interlude.  

The past will change, blow by blow,  
until there is no more shelter from the storm  
where people come and go  
talking about comics and games for adults;  
the horrors of children's' toys.  
Letting the crow sing over wind and wave,  
while watchmen keep their view  
on the borders all along the interlude.  

Is this his thrill? The beg, the moan.  
"The night doesn't need to end here."  
Hesitations unknown.  
And their glowing black was pulled together,  
by a night that seemed to last forever.  
A spectacle that sure looked like a crime,  
from a distant watch in a tilted mood,  
like another forced entry all along the interlude.  

Smoke curled around them, a demon? A wit?  
No, a hypocrite refusing to play tricks,  
for he was war,  
madness in a suit. Throwing himself at headlines,  
cashing in on past renown, bigger and better  
then any other star committing crimes  
and speaks the truth, the right-wing renewed,  
"think of the children" all along the interlude.  

The gentleman was the third seal that broke  
as he swooned and dined with mad men,  
lucky strikes with golden pens.  
"Friend, there is a lot to be gained!"  
Radiating blissful intent.  
Leaving a fat tip and calling it a day,  
while one peddles poison to the prude and crude  
chanting "I broke no law!" all along the interlude.  

  — The Sirens' Tune —  
The masked man strikes again!  
— Two scared to death  
Sunday morning a vigilante saved the day,  
or so he thought, before he was chased away  
by a man-made hurricane, a distraction for the crow.  
Please call the police if you have any clue  
why war rides all along the interlude.  

The fourth had been there biding his time,  
day by day, the routine of your life:  
"a most trusted advisor."  
Who you must call at once.  
For you find yourself amidst the worst of floods,  
and fear needs no more than a spark to turn hot,  
so you watch as the Empire subdue:  
"You rebel scum!" all along the interlude.  

"My office, now", demanded the sweaty man,  
the puppet in control whose flick of a switch  
could burn a world.  
While a watchman pulled off the greatest heist  
by staging Armageddon for the ultimate prize:  
to pass the day of our extinction.  
So let us raise a glass of crimson, to our fortitude  
against the waves all along the interlude.  

Bobcats growled just like the wind,  
while a dying fender cried out its sin.  
"Yes", they swore:  
the gentleman, charlatan, and the crow.   
For no more chaos to be brought;  
that they leave this world, its perfect storm,  
while the forth was left to reap his due  
to judge each soul all along the interlude.
