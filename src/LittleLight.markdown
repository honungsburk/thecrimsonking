# Little Light

Fickle, fickle, little light,  
how I beg you to guide my sight.  
In darkness lurks evil things,  
the hungry ends of blushing kings.  

Fickle, fickle, little light,  
how I beg you to guide my sight.  
When my king is on the run,  
lost in darkness, lost in fun,  
then you bargain for my soul.  
Fickle, fickle, I am told.  

Fickle, fickle, little light,  
How I beg you to guide my sight.
